# spam-detection

## Introduction
Spam detection is one of the major applications of Machine Learning in the interwebs today. Pretty much all of the major email service providers have spam detection systems built in and automatically classify such mail as 'Junk Mail'.

In this project, I am using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify a dataset of SMS messages as spam or not spam, based on the training. 

I am using [SMS Spam Collection Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection) from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The SMS Spam Collection is a public set of SMS labeled messages that have been collected for mobile phone spam research.

The model will classify messages as 'spam' or 'not spam'.
